How To Prepare and Present
Quality Vulnerability Reports
Preparing vulnerability reports in bug bounty programs is a critical part of clearly communicating
the security issues you’ve discovered.
It is very important to document identified vulnerabilities clearly and in detail, including information
such as their severity, potential impact, and conditions necessary to exploit them. You must also
provide clear and concrete recommendations so that the identified vulnerabilities can be remediated,
all without forgetting to create reports that are easy to understand and follow for people who do not
have technical expertise in IT security.
This chapter will provide a general guide on how to write an effective vulnerability report by covering
these topics:
• The structure of a vulnerability report
• Tips for preparing a report
• Post-report documentation
Let’s dive into the following sections!
The structure of a vulnerability report
A vulnerability report is a document that identifies and describes weaknesses or flaws in the security
of a system, software, network, application, or infrastructure.
These reports detail the weaknesses found, how they can be exploited, their potential impact, and, in
many cases, recommendations to mitigate or solve these problems.
148 How To Prepare and Present Quality Vulnerability Reports
The basic structure of the report is as follows:
1. Introduction:
 Title: A descriptive title summarizing the vulnerability.
 Executive summary: A brief description of the problem and its potential impact. It begins
with a brief but comprehensive summary of the vulnerability, including its potential impact
and how it was discovered.
2. Description:
 A detailed description of the vulnerability: This explains how the vulnerability can be
exploited, step by step. It details the context and technical description of the vulnerability,
including the exact conditions that allowed it to be exploited. This part of the report should
also include the Common Vulnerability Score System (CVSS) calculations for each
vulnerability. This page displays the components of the CVSS score and allows you to refine
the CVSS base score. The following is a screenshot from https://nvd.nist.gov/
vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator:

 Provide screenshots, executed commands, exploited code, and more to support your report.
 Prerequisites: If there are specific conditions that must be met to exploit the vulnerability,
mention them here.
 Impact: Describe the possible consequences of exploiting the vulnerability. You should
clearly explain how this vulnerability can affect the company, either in terms of security,
confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
3. Proof of Concept (PoC): Provide a clear and detailed PoC to demonstrate how the vulnerability
can be exploited. This can be code, screenshots, videos, or any other means to help others
understand the problem. Doing this provides a clear and detailed set of steps to enable security
teams to replicate the vulnerability. Attach additional evidence, such as logs, network captures,
or anything else that can help security teams understand and resolve the vulnerability. This
includes URLs, parameters, and payloads used.
4. Mitigation: Provide suggestions or solutions to correct the vulnerability. If possible, include
specific recommendations for fixing the problem. You should also highlight how the proposed
solution will improve the company’s security.
5. Additional information:
 References: If you have relied on specific research or sources, include them.
 Potential impact: Detail the possible consequences if the vulnerability is not corrected.
 Contact details: Be sure to provide the correct contact information so that the team can
reach you if they need further details or clarification.
6. Format and style: Use clear, professional formatting. Use lists, bullets, and sections to facilitate
reading and comprehension. Maintain an objective and descriptive tone.
Next, I would like to share a repository of sample vulnerability reports.
Examples of vulnerability reports
First of all, I would like to share a public GitHub repository where the contributor shares a list of
reports from different companies and security groups.
Among them are the NCC group, IO Active, NASA, MITRE, and others. The following is a screenshot
of MITRE’s report:

Now is a good opportunity to browse through this and many other reports as these serve as examples
to help you prepare your own. You can find this GitHub repository, which provides a list of reports,
at https://github.com/juliocesarfort/public-pentesting-reports/tree/
master.
I would like to share another report with you, this time created by Purple Sec. so that you can use it as
a reference to create your own. Note the structure and organization used in the report (https://

Using automation to create reports
Next, I would like to introduce a tool that will make your life easier and help you generate reports.
The BlackStone project is a tool that’s designed to automate the process of drafting and preparing
reports related to ethical hacking audits or penetration testing (pentesting). Its main objective is
to simplify and streamline the documentation process associated with these IT security activities.
154 How To Prepare and Present Quality Vulnerability Reports
The following screenshot shows the BlackStone project’s login portal:

Within this tool, it is possible to enter the vulnerabilities that you identified during the audit into a
database. These vulnerabilities are organized according to their internal, external, or Wi-Fi networkrelated
origin. In addition to registering them, detailed information can be included, such as their
description, recommendations, level of severity, and the estimated difficulty of solving them. All this
information is useful to generate a summary table showing the criticality of the vulnerabilities found.
The following screenshot shows an example of this:

It is also possible to register a company in the tool. By entering only its website, the tool can discover
subdomains, telephone numbers, social network profiles, and email addresses belonging to the
company’s employees.
The following screenshot shows an example of this:
Figure 9.9 – Vulnerabilities identified during the audit
You can use this tool both in your daily life, while real pentesting audits, as well as when generating
certification exams.

• Be ethical: Be sure to follow the rules of the bug bounty program and do not access more
information than allowed to demonstrate the vulnerability.
• Readable format: Use a clear and readable format, with well-defined sections for easy reading.
• Solutions: Provide a possible solution to the vulnerability.
• Collaboration: Be open to collaborating with the security team to provide more details or
information if needed.
Always remember to follow the specific guidelines of the bug bounty program you are participating
in as they may have specific requirements or formats for vulnerability reporting.
With that, you know how to create a report. Now, you will learn everything you need to know about
after submitting the report.
Post-report documentation
When it comes to post-report documentation, be sure to follow the responsible disclosure guidelines
set forth by the bug bounty program and not publicly disclose the vulnerability until the company
has had time to resolve it.
Summary 157
Also, if possible, provide availability to help security teams better understand the vulnerability or
conduct additional testing.
Remember that quality and clarity are critical in these reports. Make sure your report is well-structured,
concise, and supported by concrete evidence so that it can be easily addressed by the company’s
security teams.
